## Statue of Zeus at Olympia

According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife, Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus . The construction of the Hanging Gardens has also been attributed to the legendary queen Semiramis  and they have been called the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis as an alternative name.
