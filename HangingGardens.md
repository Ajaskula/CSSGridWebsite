## Hanging Gardens of Babylon

According to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits, or 33 metres (108 feet) high – approximately the height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown – making it the tallest statue in the ancient world .  It collapsed during the earthquake of 226 BC, although parts of it were preserved. In accordance with the Oracle of Delphi, the Rhodians did not rebuild it.   John Malalas wrote that Hadrian in his reign re-erected the Colossus,  but he was mistaken.  According to the Suda, the Rhodians were called Colossaeans ( Κολοσσαεῖς ), because they erected the statue on the island.
