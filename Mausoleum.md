## Mausoleum at Halicarnassus

The Mausoleum was approximately 45 m (148 ft) in height, and the four sides were adorned with sculptural reliefs, each created by one of four Greek sculptors: Leochares, Bryaxis, Scopas of Paros, and Timotheus .  The Mausoleum contained total 400 freestanding sculptures.  The mausoleum was considered to be such an aesthetic triumph that Antipater of Sidon identified it as one of his Seven Wonders of the Ancient World . It was destroyed by successive earthquakes from the 12th to the 15th century;    it was the last surviving of the six destroyed wonders.
